# Manuall-dns

## Pre-requirement
- create a empty file named c:\pythonWork\ip.txt to keep the current ip address
- create a windows schedule to run ip.cmd every 5 mins
- put the ip2.py into c:\pythonWork
- replace the email address and email token as you wish in the ip2.py

## Logic
- send a http request to internet to get ip address
- if the ip changes from local txt file, send a email to qq email. so you can get the address change alert
